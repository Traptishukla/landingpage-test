# **App Name**: Kylas Landing Page

## Core Features:

- Visual Clone: Faithfully reproduce the visual appearance, structure, and responsive behavior of the Kylas landing page.
- Interactive Navbar: Navigation bar with functional links (smooth scroll to sections, dropdown menus for Industries and Resources).
- Testimonial Carousel: Testimonial slider with working navigation arrows. Animate the transition between testimonials for a smooth user experience.
- Interactive Elements: Implement subtle animations on hover for buttons and interactive elements to improve user engagement.
- Intelligent Demo Scheduling: AI-powered tool to analyze user engagement and automatically recommend optimal demo times.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Medium blue (#1877F2), reflecting trust and reliability.
- Background color: Light blue (#E6F0FF), a desaturated shade of the primary for a clean, professional backdrop.
- Accent color: Cyan (#4DD0E1), a brighter, less saturated analogous hue to highlight key actions and information.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, to provide both a modern and accessible feel for all text elements.  Recommendation: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use FontAwesome or Lucide icons throughout the site for key symbols to provide visual cues to supplement the landing page.
- Employ Flexbox and Grid layouts extensively to ensure the landing page responds elegantly at all screen sizes. Note special attention is required for the hero image, and the Trusted logos sections.
- Add smooth scrolling for in-page navigation links, as well as subtle animations on interactive elements like buttons, the testimonial carousel and other areas of the landing page.
